description: Perform deep sequential thinking and analysis before implementation

Use the sequential thinking tool to thoroughly analyze and solve the following task: $ARGUMENTS

## Sequential Thinking Requirements:

1. **Fully understand the problem space** - Break down the problem into its fundamental components and identify all stakeholders, constraints, and requirements.

2. **Consider multiple approaches and tradeoffs** - Evaluate at least 3 different solutions, analyzing pros/cons, performance implications, maintainability, and scalability for each approach.

3. **Ultra-think through edge cases and error handling** - Systematically identify potential failure modes, boundary conditions, race conditions, security vulnerabilities, and exceptional scenarios.

4. **Plan the architecture before coding** - Design the system architecture, data flow, component interactions, and integration points. Consider patterns, principles (SOLID, DRY, KISS), and best practices.

5. **Optimize for clarity, correctness, and maintainability** - Prioritize code readability, comprehensive error handling, proper documentation, testability, and long-term maintenance over premature optimization.

## Process:

- Start with broad analysis and progressively refine understanding
- Question assumptions and revisit earlier thoughts when new insights emerge
- Branch into alternative approaches when needed
- Generate and verify solution hypotheses
- Continue until a robust, well-reasoned solution is reached

Take your time to think deeply about the best solution. Quality of analysis takes precedence over speed.
