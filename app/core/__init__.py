# Core Application
# =============================================================================
# This app contains infrastructure/skeleton code that provides a foundation
# for the application. Following the skeleton project rules, this contains:
#
# - BaseModel: Abstract model with common fields (timestamps)
# - Health check endpoint: For Docker/Kubernetes/load balancer health probes
#
# Business logic should NOT go here. Extend core classes in your domain apps.
